# üê© DoodleDogs

A complete puppy adoption management system built using C#.

It includes:

Desktop App (WPF): A user-friendly Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application that allows staff to manage puppies, adoptions, and users locally. Features include adopting puppies, tracking adoption status, and managing user information.

Web App (ASP.NET MVC): A responsive, full-stack web version of the system built using ASP.NET MVC. It mirrors the functionality of the desktop version, allowing remote access for users to view available puppies and admins to create/update/delete puppies and litters.

Shared Backend: Both apps are powered by shared C# logic, data access layers, and a common database, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication. The solution also includes shared data fakes and test layers to ensure reliable unit testing and maintain high code quality across the application.

Technologies Used: C#, WPF, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, TSQL/SQL Server
